    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the greatest benefits of developing rails applications with a framework like Ruby on Rails is the flexibility of being able to access a data from our databases without having to write ugly SQL statements. While SQL is a very powerful and efficient language for retrieving data, at least to this author, is nowhere near as elegant or intuitive as Ruby.</p>

<p>As part of the Rails framework, we have access to ActiveRecord, a Ruby DSL (domain specific language) that allows us to communicate with the database with ease. ActiveRecord builds out custom methods that erase the blood-brain barrier of database and our Ruby model classes. It allows our models to treat its relevant data as though they were were attributes of each instance of a particular class.</p>

<p>My first instinct as someone who has recently fallen in love with Ruby is to try to do as much with that language as possible. The problem with that it is nowhere near as efficient as using a simple SQL statement. In our labs and early projects, that isn’t really an issue as the size of our databases and programs don’t require the efficiency of a larger scale application. But as students, we need to train ourselves to develop good coding habits! That is where ActiveRecord comes in to play.</p>

<h2>Experiment</h2>

<p><img src="http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/For+science_3cf7fb_4751731.jpg" alt="For science!" /></p>

<p>To begin our test, I created a simple domain model that many of my Flatiron classmates would be very familiar with: <code>Artist</code> and <code>Song</code>. I seeded the database with 100 artists and 100,000 songs, each randomly assigned to an artist in the database.</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="n">make_artists</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">make_songs</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For our experiment we’ll be executing a simple query: Which artist has the most songs?</p>

<h2>Approach 1: Ruby</h2>

<p>We create a primitive data structure, load in our data and sort with basic ruby methods. We create a giant hash where each artist in the database is a key pointing to an array of each of their songs. We then sort by the size of values to find our artist with the most songs.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='Ruby'><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">most_songs_ruby</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">hash</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="no">Artist</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">artist</span><span class="o">|</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nb">hash</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">artist</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">artist</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">songs</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">hash</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">max_by</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">size</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Given 100,000 songs, this approach takes us between 1.7 and 1.8 seconds. EONS!!! Let&rsquo;s try it with ActiveRecord and SQL.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='Ruby'><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">most_songs_sql</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">joins</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:songs</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">group</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:artist_id</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">order</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;COUNT(*) DESC&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">limit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">first</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Using ActiveRecord, we join up the <code>artists</code> and <code>songs</code> table, group our results by <code>artist_id</code>, and order our results by the count of songs each artist has.
ActiveRecord then translates this into a SQL statement that queries our database.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='SQL'><span class='line'><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">songs</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">INNER</span> <span class="k">JOIN</span> <span class="n">artists</span> <span class="k">ON</span> <span class="n">artist_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">artists</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">GROUP</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">artist_id</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="k">COUNT</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">DESC</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>ActiveRecord gets the same answer as Ruby using a single SQL statement. Given 100,000 songs, this approach takes us 280ms.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>ActiveRecord / SQL gets us our answer 6 times as fast as Ruby. 1.7 seconds might not seem like a long time, but imagine instead of 100,000 songs, our database had millions. With some applications both speed and memory might become issues.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since starting <a href="http://www.flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a>, I&rsquo;ve seen an increasing number of articles about coding schools and bootcamps. Most of the coverage is pretty positive - generally people support the idea that a) learning to code is a valuable skill and b) education should as a general rule prepare people to enter the workforce.</p>

<p>But one article in the Washington Post that was recently sent my way bothered me a great deal. While it talks about some of the success stories from my coding school, the author isn&rsquo;t all positive.</p>

<blockquote><p>The bigger challenge, I fear, is how well these kinds of programs will scale.
Unlike most training programs, Flatiron is extraordinarily selective. Its admissions rate of 6 percent rivals Harvard’s. All admits must go through interviews with both co-founders and jump through other hoops such as coding a tic-tac-toe game (even if they have no background in programming). It’s no wonder, then, that employers return again and again to Flatiron for high-quality hires: Flatiron has not only trained these students, but has also pre-screened them to make sure it ends up offering only the most perseverant, passionate, marketable workers around.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m encouraged by the success stories. I really did my research to try to get into the right school and hope to have the same success. But when the authors says that Flation is successful because it is so selective and &ldquo;The bigger challenge, I fear, is how well these kinds of programs will scale&rdquo; - this bothers me.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t everybody know the reason Harvard graduates are so successful is because Harvard is so selective? It&rsquo;s not the education - its the pre-screened candidates getting to build a life long professional network with other pre-screened students. Why is nobody asking that question about a liberal arts college education?</p>

<p>It is literally insane that we not only encourage but de facto require teenagers to virtually mortgage their futures to spend four years doing something that prepares them to enter an economy that existed in 1985 but has changed drastically today.</p>

<p>Part of the backlash, I wonder, is an entrenched workforce - both within tech and in other industries - who might somehow feel as if coding schools are &ldquo;cheating&rdquo; and not playing by a set of unspoken rules: pay your dues, do your time, and only then are you allowed to get a job. We sometimes have a tendency to put down another&rsquo;s route to make ourselves feel better about the fact that we took the scenic route.</p>

<p>So while yes - buyer beware of these coding programs and do your research as I did - but if someone wants to spend 10 or 15 thousand dollars learning to code people start to freak out, but an 18 year old can study creative writing at a small liberal arts college for 4 years of their life, spend $160,000 or be in debt for years with no immediate job prospects and no one bats an eye. Maybe policy makers do need to keep an eye on these new schools, but I wish that logic were applied to college too.</p>

<p>If it is incumbent on a professional school to put up high job placement numbers, why don&rsquo;t we hold college to the same standard? If Flatiron and similar schools are successful I don&rsquo;t think the end result will necessarily be that everyone will skip college for technical training - my hope is that their success will force colleges to take a look what they are doing to prepare students to enter the world.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have always been fascinated by probability. Everything that is going to happen can be expressed in terms of probability. Of course, just because something <em>can</em> be expressed that way doesn&rsquo;t mean we always have the tools to accurately express it. But sometimes we <em>do</em> know, objetively, what the likelihood something is going to occur and we ignore it anyway. That&rsquo;s because humans are notoriously bad at understanding probabilities and effectively changing our behaviors based on those numbers. Very few people are afraid of driving, but many (including your faithful author) are terrified of flying even though for sometime the most dangerous part of a commercial flight is driving to the airport.</p>

<p>I think part of the reason for this is that for the most part, we&rsquo;ve been taught to approach probablistic problems with math. Why is this a problem? Because I suck at math. Also, we descended from apes. They don&rsquo;t typically consult actuarial tables when determining whether the sound in the bush is a predator.</p>

<h2>The Birthday Problem</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick question: If you stick a random group of people in a room, what the odds that 2 of them have the same birthday? Or to be more specific, how many people do you need for there to be at least a 50% chance that two of them share a birthday. The first time I heard this I thought &ldquo;well you&rsquo;d probably need 182.5 people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s wrong. You only need 23 people for there to be a better than 50% chance that two of them share the same birthday. Do you know how to solve this with math?</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/c/7/9c7763ad00291fc5be64923ea6d831d3.png" alt="MATH" /></p>

<p>This is <s>garbage</s> pretty hard to understand.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s why I LOVE programming - especially object oriented programming. Ruby allows me to think about how I would approach solving the problem, not just algorithmically but in the literal sense - with words. How would we solve this problem? We&rsquo;d take a bunch of people, give them a random birthday, and then check to see if any of them share the same birthday. We&rsquo;d do this a lot - say, 50,000 times - and take the average. Programming lets us do this in a couple lines of code. Math does not. Make a new instance of the <code>Birthday</code> class and pass in how many people you want to test for and how many simulations you want to run.</p>

<p>Looks like we were pretty close. That was pretty fun! Let&rsquo;s do another one. This might cause some controversy.</p>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s Make a Deal</h2>

<p>Marilyn vos Savant, is aptly named as she&rsquo;s a genius with one of the highest recorded IQ&rsquo;s on record, if you care about that sort of thing. She even had a syndicated column in Parade magazine where people wrote in with brain teasers. Her most famous column was about the notorious &ldquo;Monty Hall Problem.&rdquo; She answered the question correctly, but not before being publicly lambasted by some of the country&rsquo;s &ldquo;leading&rdquo; math and statistics experts. To this day the problem causes a fight whenever it comes up.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the scenario. You&rsquo;re on a game show and the host says &ldquo;There are 3 doors. Behind one of these doors is a car. Behind the other two are goats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You pick Door #1. The host will then open one of the two remaining doors that contains a goat - let&rsquo;s say he opens Door #3. Then you are given the option to keep your original choice of Door #1 or switch to Door #2.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the question: is it better to keep your original pick or switch to the other remaining door? Or does it not matter?</p>

<p>Of course, when I first heard this problem I thought &ldquo;Easy - it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you switch or not. Its a 50/50 coin flip. Two doors, two choices. One is a goat, one is a car. The answer is it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you switch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It really hurt my brain to find out this was very wrong. It is always better to switch. Like 100% better. Twice as good. But I didn&rsquo;t feel too bad. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem#Vos_Savant_and_the_media_furor">Math professors were getting it wrong too.</a></p>

<p>Writing code to solve this problem not only gives you the answer, but helps you understand the problem the better.</p>

<p>This script puts &ldquo;car&rdquo; in a slot in an array, gives the user a random pick, and then tests whether keeping the user&rsquo;s pick or switching results in winning the car. In the end, of course we find that when you switch doors you will win the car 66.6% of the time and will win the car only 33.3% when you keep your original choice.</p>

<p>But the code skips a step - it skips the part where the host opens a door and then gives the contestant the choice. Why does it skip that part? BECAUSE IT IS IRRELEVANT TO THE OUTCOME.</p>

<p>The above code is an exercise in futility, as it simply an obfuscated way of testing how random your computer&rsquo;s random number generator is. But that&rsquo;s the point of Monty Hall. It tries to hide how simple the problem is. The question shouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;is it to your advantage to switch doors?&rdquo; That is just a fancier way of asking &ldquo;what are the odds that your original pick was correct?&rdquo; That is obvious and intuitive: 1 in 3. The fact that the host opens one of the doors DOES NOT CHANGE THIS. Your original pick is still only a 1 in 3 shot of being right. Ergo, the one remaining door will have the car 2/3 of the time.</p>

<p>This is why programming is fun. Without the benefit of math, we have to express these complex problems in abstract, metaphorical terms that are easier to understand regardless of your background in math.</p>

    <id>http://jeremysklarsky.github.io/blog/2015/02/15/bash-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-terminal</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Background</h2>

<p>When you first had a computer, how did you use it? Some of that will depend on when you were born. My family first purchased a computer (custom built IBM Compatible Clone!) when I was 9, in 1992. It did not have Windows. It was DOS.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS#Origins">DOS was Microsoft&rsquo;s version of UNIX.</a></p>

<p><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_dNWdTN1SaKE/SpKeAYT9cyI/AAAAAAAAAN8/f-ev43N3Cjk/msdos71%5B6%5D.png?imgmax=800" alt="DOS" /></p>

<p>One time, I thought it would be funny to delete the contents of my computer&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUTOEXEC.BAT">autoexec.bat</a> file. This was basically a set of plain text instructions for what the computer should do when you turned it on. Turns out &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; is what happens when you delete those contents. Literally. We had to call a tech-savvy neighbor who brought a copy of his file to rewrite ours.</p>

<p>At 9 years old I was opening files, making new directories, and searching all from the DOS prompt. But then Windows happened, I got into Apple products, and was spoiled forever. Typing clunky commands seemed pretty archaic compared to pointing at what you want and getting it on demand, and less precise. I thought UNIX would be lost on me forever.</p>

<h2>Enter the Terminal</h2>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Grand_Central_Station_Main_Concourse_Jan_2006.jpg" alt="GCT" /><br>^<em>This is a terminal. People are so afraid of Terminal they call this thing Grand Central Station instead.</em></p>

<p>This, it turns out, was incorrect thinking. Windows and OSX are the bouncers of the computing world. They tell you what you can do and how to do it. Terminal, on the other hand is like the guy who works at the bar, lets you in when the place is closed and lets drink whatever you want.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="images/bouncer-black-text.png" title="This is your OS" ></p>

<p>The biggest benefit is speed.</p>

<p>Most people in Flatiron School know about tab completion at this point. Quite simply, while in a directory, start typing the name of a file or folder, hit tab, and Terminal will finish your command for you. From your home directory, &ldquo;$cd doc&rdquo; <em>hit tab</em> becomes &ldquo;$cd Documents&rdquo; pretty quickly. If you have multiple files that start with similar strings, there is a helper shortcut for you too. Option+ Tab will give you a list of folders and files in your directory starting with a string such that &ldquo;$cd d&rdquo; <em>option+tab</em> will yield <em>Desktop/   Documents/ Downloads/ Dropbox/   dev/</em> so you&rsquo;ll at least know what you&rsquo;re working with.</p>

<p>The real fun is the speed and convenience that comes from automation. With a few quick key commands, custom Bash scripts, and aliases. You can save yourself major time. Let&rsquo;s look at a few by opening up our bash profile.</p>

<h3>Building our own scripts</h3>

<ul>
<li>cd ~</li>
<li>&ldquo;What was the name of that file? <em>types ls</em>&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Hmm, must be a hidden file&rdquo; <em>types ls -a</em></li>
<li>OK. <em>subl .bash_profile</em></li>
<li>&ldquo;Man that was annoying, and now I&rsquo;ve forgotten what directory I used to be in.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>We could simply type <em>subl ~/.bash_profile</em> but even that get tedious. So let&rsquo;s add this function to our profile. Now when we type &ldquo;subl-bash&rdquo; anywhere in Terminal. And guess what, tab completion works for functions too.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>  <span class="k">function</span> subl-bash <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>          subl ~/.bash_profile
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That was fun. Let&rsquo;s make another one. What&rsquo;s something you want to do almost every time you make a new directory? Generally its navigate into that directory.</p>

<ul>
<li>mkdir my-awesome-directory</li>
<li>cd my-awesome-directory</li>
</ul>


<p>I think we can cut that down to one line of code. Like ruby, Bash functions can take an argument (), and then we access them in our function with $. So &ldquo;mkcd <em>directory name</em> will now create a directory and navigate to it one shot.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>  <span class="k">function</span> mkcd <span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>          mkdir <span class="nv">$1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c">#makes the directory</span>
</span><span class='line'>          <span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$1</span><span class="p">;</span>    <span class="c">#navigates to the new directory</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What&rsquo;s another thing we do as Flatiron students <em>literally</em> every day? We clone a git repository, try to remember the name of repo, and then navigate into that directoy. With this script, utilizing the bash command &lsquo;basename&rsquo; [<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/44735/how-to-get-only-filename-using-sed">1</a>] you can clone and navigate with a single command. Use this script by simply typing &ldquo;gcl&rdquo; and pasting the address of the github page you want to clone.</p>

<p>This one&rsquo;s my favorite so far. First, install the <a href="https://github.com/prasmussen/chrome-cli">chrome-cli gem</a>. This gives you command line access to chrome.</p>

<p>Then, add this function to your .bash_profile. Enter &ldquo;labs&rdquo; into Terminal and in one shot we navigate to our labs directory, close whatever nonsense we have open in Chrome, and go to the Ironboard login page.</p>

<p>This next one navigates us to my blog&rsquo;s directory, opens the posts folder in sublime, opens chrome to my local preview, and generates a local preview of the blog.

<p>Now we have one word shortcuts to get our most commonly used directories. Think how much time we can save just over the course of the semester with a few of these shortcuts. The Terminal is our oyster.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Authors note: This is my first ever post!</em></p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>My first two weeks at <a href="http://www.flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a> have been an absolute whirlwind. I can feel us slowly approaching a time when we can <strong>actually</strong> deploy our skills and do something useful.</p>

<p>Diving into Ruby headfirst has been a joy, though it remained largely in the realm of theoretical and hypothetical. I&rsquo;m not one scoff at intellectual exercises for their own sake, but the painstaking task of iterating over made up hashes was starting to test my own powers of concentration and emotional constitution.</p>

<p>Among the more powerful lectures have involved data scraping and parsing demonstrations.</p>

<p>In a couple of quick clicks our lead <s>guru</s> instructor managed to pull all the prices of every apartment listed on craigslist and find the average. Looks like we haven&rsquo;t been iterating for nothing. BOOM!</p>

<br>^everyone in class.</p>

<h2>Writing a Yelp-er Method</h2>

<p>That looked like fun and I wanted a turn. For some years I&rsquo;ve been fairly obsessed with data collection and manipulation. But my participation in the sport was limited by both, obviously, my data collection and manipulation abilities. But no longer! In my first two weeks as a developer, I&rsquo;ve learned to adopt the idea that I am not limited by what my computer tells me what I&rsquo;m allowed to do. It is a tool to do my bidding!</p>

<p>For my test case, I thought scraping <a href="http://www.yelp.com">Yelp</a> would be a good place to start. After a few clicks, I realized the easiest way to access Yelp&rsquo;s API would not be parsing a long JSON string like we had in the Spotify lab. Luckily for you, dear readers, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview">Yelp&rsquo;s API documentation</a> lead us to a very helpful Ruby gem for parsing search results directly into a hash with tons of data pertaining to your search.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get started:<br>
1. In terminal, run &lsquo;gem install yelp&rsquo;.<br>
2. &lsquo;require yelp&rsquo; in your ruby program, or include &lsquo;yelp&rsquo; in your gemfile.<br>
3. Make a million dollars.</p>

<p>When the interpreter runs this code, your client object has access to all of the methods defined in the gem. You interact with Yelp&rsquo;s data by using a the parameters laid out in their API within the gem&rsquo;s syntax. Yelp gives you plenty of helpful tags to customize your search. Check out the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api">documentation</a> in the search API for some of them.</p>

<p>For our test search, I focused on some pretty basic ones: search for Italian restaurants in the nearby neighborhood of Park Slope. The return of this search is an array like object called a Burst, which contains instances of Business objects.</p>

<p>Yelp then has a separate <a href="http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/business">Business API</a> for accessing the info in the returned data structure. The gem lets us call them as methods on each individual business object returned in the Burst. Here are a few of the major ones.</p>

<p>From there we have a hash with which we can do anything we want. Sort by rating, sort by rating and most reviews, create adjusted ratings for restaurant categories based on the category average (i.e. grading the restaurant on a curve), whatever we want. The world (wide web) is our oyster!</p>
